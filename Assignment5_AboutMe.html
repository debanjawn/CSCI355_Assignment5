    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, at the current date I am a CS major at Queens College. I have been passionate about tech since I was very young and I want to continue working to become a Software Developer. I have interned at Capital One as a Software development intern and also at Goldman Sachs as a Product Management Intern. This summer I will be going to Atlassian and will be returning to a SWE role. I am very excited about the future and what is to come. Please feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debanjan-mazumder/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
